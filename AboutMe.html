							<h1>About Cindy</h1>
							<p class="major">Cindy Roberts, CEOLD, PT is a Certified End of Life Doula who is honored to accompany clients and their loved ones' at end of life. An End of Life Doula is a person who provides non-medical, holistic support and care for the dying and their loved ones before, during and after death. Mind, body and Spirit are all honored and cared for. 

                               <p class ="major"> Having over 25 years of experience in Health Care, as well as her personal experiences companioning family, clients and two beloved friends through death and dying, Cindy has a firm understanding of the challenges faced by patients and their loved ones as they navigate through curative, palliative and comfort care. While end of life care is not the setting for restoration or curing of the physical body, the role of the doula is to offer compassionate support as disease processes progress. Cindy’s doula skills are informed by her clinical understanding of how the bodily systems function as well as how they slow down and let go at the end of life. </p>
                                
                               <p class="major">As a licensed Physical Therapist, Cindy has provided individualized care since 1993 in both inpatient hospitals and home health settings. In addition to treating orthopedic conditions, she has provided evaluation and treatment to those diagnosed with progressive diseases including cancer, cardiopulmonary, and neurologic conditions. She is certified in NDT for the treatment of neurologic disorders. She is a member of the APTA’s Oncology Section and Hospice and Palliative Care Special Interest group. Cindy understands the importance of supporting not only patients, but also their loved ones as they navigate both medical and emotional transitions. Cindy currently provides Physical Therapy services as a contractor for Home Health and Hospice Agencies in Austin and surrounding areas. Doula services are provided through her Seasons of Life private practice.</p>
							   <p>Cindy has a great love and reverence for the natural world and receives  inspiration from the renewing cycles and seasons of life. On daily walks and hikes, she finds  herself drawn outdoors  along the many beautiful trails of Austin seeking a space for celebration, grief and  healing. Trees, plants and animal life (especially birds) provide a means for her to stay grounded and connected to the source of life. All photographs on this website were created by Cindy on her various wanderings along the trails.</p>
